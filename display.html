        A larger screen size is ideal for gaming, watching movies,photos or video editing and complex data visualization;while a smaller screen size is lighter and easier to carry around. <br>
    Do remember the bigger the screen, heavier the leptop. This is because of all the glass that goes into making the display, which has to be made durable and hence,the added weight.</p>   
    <p>Sizes are Like upto 12.9 inch , 13inch- 15.9inch, 16 inch & above etc.</p>

    <h5>Display Resolution</h5>
    <h3>Higher screen resolution = Sharp,clear and rich visual experience</h3>
    <p>The most common screen resolutions are HD Ready,Full HD and 4K.<br>
        Screen resolution is measured as the pixel count and is mentioned in horizontal and vertical pixel count.</p>
        <h3>Display Resolution</h3>
        <h3>HD or HD ready </h3>
        <p>Available in entry level & budget laptops,this display has 1366 x 768 pixel count.<br>

    These produce even sharper images and are ideal for high resolution video editing,watching 4K videos or 
graphic intensive gaming. <br>
It is the most expensive display</p>as it a balance between cost,good visuals and battery life.
<p><i>One tip - Full HD is currently the recommended resolution as it a balance between cost,good visuals and battery life. </i></p>
<h5>Other factors</h5> 
<h6><center>Screen Types : IPS vs Non-IPS</center></h6>
<p>IPS (in-plane switching) display show life-like colors, the way they were meant to be, all while allowing 2-3 people to huddle around your screen without any loss in brightness.<br>
