        <p> There was a time what that phones came only in 2 colours,black and white.
But no longer. These days phones are coming in varied colors.Brands are making not just solid colors.Brands are making not just solid color device but also experimenting with gradient colors as well.
        So if you have a perference, check if the brand you are wanting is offering that color.
        </p>



      <p>  In today's time, it is important to ensure that the smartphone is water-resistent, esp. when 
        the smartphones are complete displays now if the phone is not waterproof, chances of the phone getting damaged subject to getting wet is high.<br>
         If this is a concern of you,make sure to check this before buying a phone.<br>
         If it is not that necessary, you cannot fret about it.

         The time for which your phones lasts on one charge depends on the usage,power efficiency of the processor, screen resolution & battery capacity.<br>
        Most of the smartphones today are coming with 3500-4000mAh batteries,sufficient enough to provide 1 days charge on normal use.

       Resolution refers to the number of pixels your camer has, which means the amount of details that the camera can capture.<br>
       It is measured in megapixels (MP). A megapixel means one million pixels.<br>
       The higher the number of MP,the higher will be the resolution and the more details you will be able to capture i.e. you will be able to zoom the image more without it getting pixelated.<br>
       A camera with higher resolution will be able to capture images with more details & sharpness.<br>
       However, just a high MP does not ensure perfect clicks. There are other contributing factors as well.

        In addition to this some smartphone makers add their layers on top of stock Android OS and these are known as Custom Android versions.-For example EMUI (Huawei), MIUI (Xiaomi) etc. Usually, phones with stock android deliver the best performance.<br>
        While choosing an OS, you need to be mindfulof the following things:<br>
        1. Affordability<br>
        2. Apps available<br>
        3. Security<br>
        4. Updates<br>
        5. Customization<br>

       1.1 Affordability:<br>
       No doubt that Apple is the most expensive product out there.If you are keen to opt for a phone that won't be too heavy on your pockets, best to look for your desired features in an android phone.But if you're set on iPhone & won't opt for anything other than Apple,you surely can go for it. Though expemnsive, they give the most amazing interface to the end-user.

        1.2 Apps available:<br>
        While you will find that most of the free apps that are there on Android are present on iOS as well, but if you are a hardcore gamer and love to explore & play new games, opting for iOS is the best option since there are some of the best gaming apps that are only available in the App Store. The reason mostly is that the iOS interface provides a better gaming experience compared to the varied Android environment.

        1.3 Sequrity:<br>
        Though, both Android & Apple are secure platforms. There is no threat of malware if you are downloading via the specific stores (Google Play Store & App Store). But when it comes to deep check of apps, Apple is much more secure & difficult to breach. Thus, if you’re looking for high level security & privacy, you should opt for iOS.

      <td>
        1.4 Updates:<br>
        iOS has a better update mechanism. Most of their phone models will be running on the latest versions of OS. The same is not true for Android, since the older phones are not eligible for updates, thus making them vulnerable to malware attacks. Android provides security patches for up to 2 years only. So if you want to stick to your phone for a while, investing in an iPhone is a better option.

        1.5 Customizability:<br>
        As a user, Android gives you more flexibility to customise the UI of the phone. You can modify the way apps are listed, the layout of the home screens, adding multiple widgets. And many more. iOS, however, does not provide such customisation. If you’re looking for a phone that lets you customise it the way you want, going for an Android will be the right choice.

        1.6 Accessibility:<br>
        When it comes to accessibility, iOS is far easier, simpler to use, for one reason that it works the same across devices & models. This is not true when it comes to Android devices, because each Android phone can work and operate in a different way thus making it not very easy to seamlessly move from one device to another. If you’re looking for a phone that allows seamless usage across devices, going for iOS is the best option.
