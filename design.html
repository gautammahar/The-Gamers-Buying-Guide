        <p><b>Which form factor and design should i choose ?</b></p>
  <h5>Basic Laptops | For everyday and light weight use</h5>  
<p>Basic laptops have a traditional clam-type design, with a screen that folds down onto the keyboard and mousepad<br>
They are generally less expensive than touchscreen or 2 -in- 1 models.<br>
These are the most common and affordable laptops and are sufficient for most users.</p>
<h5>Thin and Light weight Laptops | For people on the go</h5>
<p>These ar laptops below 1.8kgs in weight and usually have a display size of 14 inches or lower.<br>
They are slim, portable, and lightweight - meaning they are a great choice for those who want a poweful device they can take with them on the ho.<br>
Thin and light weight laptops are generally considered to be innovative in their design as they pack in top end sepcifications in a thin and light body.<br>
Nowadays there are thin and light laptops available from all top brands in the market, as of 2019.</p>
<h5>Touchscreen</h5>
<p>Laptops with touchscreen display enable scribbling on screen to edit documents directly with the help of a stylus or screen scrolling, zooming and other such controls using your fingers.<br>
This makes your laptop experience similar to that of a tablet or a smartphone.</p>
<h5>2-in-1 Laptops</h5>
<p><b>2-in-1 Laptops are versatile devices that can function as both a laptop and as a tablet. <br> There are two types of 2-in-1 laptops : Detachable and Convertible </b></p>
<p><i>This is ideal for those whow want the flexibility to use the leptop in the traditional laptop mode or tablet mode.</i></p>
<h5>1. Detachable 2-in-1</h5>
<p>With a detachable, the display of the laptop actully detaches from the keyboard, meaning you can use it like a tablet.<br>
Some detachable 2-in-1s have a limited space,processor and battery capacity. Hence, detachable 2-in-1s are often slightly lower-powered than convertible ones.<br>
Some detachble 2-in-1s overcome this by including two processors (one in the display, the other in the main body), or only including a small battery in the display portion, and a larger battery to be used when the display and keyboard are attached.</p>
<h5>Convertible 2-in-1 </h5>
<p>In 2-in-1 convertible laptop the screen cannot be detached.<br>
Instead. the screen can rotate 360 degrees (all the way around),meaning the keyboard goes on the bottom and the display goes on the top.<br>
The resulting form is a little thicker version of a tablet,but often more powerful thanks to the extra space for internal thanks to the extra space for internal components.</p>
<h5>Gaming Laptops</h5>
<p><b>Additional things to keep in mind</b></p>
<p>Gaming laptops are generally equipped with poweful hardware and a sturdy design,IPS display and a dedicated graphics card.<br>
Generally, gaming laptops are heavier and bulkier than basic or business laptops, but  with all that extra space,manufacturers  are able to fit more powerful processors, widescreen IPS displays with higher refresh rates, larger batteries,and often even graphics processing units, or GPUs.<br>
These are ideal for usage in one place and com promise on portability while delivering superior performance.</p>
<p><b>Lid & body</b></p>
<p>The lid and body - typically made from plastics or aluminums - should be adequately flexible and light weight.<br>
Most laptops have an angle of rotation of around 90 to 120 degrees. There are a few laptops in which the lid can rotate 180 degrees, meaning lower chances of breakage. Convertible 2-in-1s allow for a rotation of up to 360 degrees.</p>
<h5>Keyboard</h5>
<p>Chiclet style keyboards generally have flat and shallow keys allow for easy typing.<br>
The keyboard's spacing and depth should allow for comfortable typing.<br>
Many laptops come with a bcklit keyboard,look out for this feature in case you wish to use your laptop in the dark. </p>
